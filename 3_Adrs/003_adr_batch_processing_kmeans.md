**Architectural Decision Record (ADR)**

**1. Title**

**Adoption of FAISS K-Means for Clustering Ungraded Answers to Optimize
LLM API Usage**

**2. Context**

In our short-answer grading system, we need to process a large volume of
ungraded responses efficiently while minimizing API costs. Each response
requires an LLM call, making individual processing expensive and
inefficient. Our key objectives include:

-   **Batch Processing:** Reduce the number of LLM API calls by grouping
    similar responses.

-   **Lower API Costs:** Optimize LLM token usage by avoiding redundant
    processing of similar answers.

-   **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle large datasets without
    performance degradation.

-   **High Accuracy in Grading:** Maintain grading consistency across
    clustered answers.

Given these requirements, we explored multiple clustering techniques to
group similar responses before sending them to the LLM for batch
processing.

**3. Decision**

We have selected **FAISS K-Means** as the clustering method for ungraded
answers to enable batch processing and reduce redundant LLM API calls.

**Rationale**

-   **Efficient Clustering:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
    provides **high-speed nearest neighbour search**, allowing us to
    efficiently cluster similar short answers.

-   **Reduced LLM API Calls:** Grouping similar answers allows us to
    send a **single batched request** instead of individual API calls,
    cutting costs significantly.

-   **Optimized Token Usage:** By clustering, we ensure that answers
    within a batch stay within LLM token constraints, avoiding
    unnecessary splits.

-   **Scalability:** FAISS K-Means is highly optimized for large-scale
    clustering and can handle millions of responses efficiently.

**Rejected Alternatives & Trade-offs**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Alternative**      **Reason for Rejection**
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  **DBSCAN**           Struggles with high-dimensional embeddings and may
                       classify too many responses as noise, reducing
                       batch efficiency.

  **Hierarchical       Computationally expensive for large datasets,

  **Manual Rule-Based  Difficult to maintain and lacks adaptability to

  Calls)**             
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. Architecture Impact**

-   **New Components:**

    -   **FAISS K-Means Clustering Module**: Groups ungraded answers
        into semantically similar clusters before passing them to the
        LLM.

    -   **Batch Processing System**: Handles API requests efficiently by
        sending grouped responses for grading.

-   **Integration Points:**

    -   FAISS integrates with our **vector database** for similarity
        search.

    -   Works alongside **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to
        ensure responses are retrieved effectively.

    -   Outputs are stored in the **Aptitude Test Grade Database** for
        future reference.

-   **Performance Considerations:**

    -   Clustering must be executed **within seconds** to maintain
        system responsiveness.

    -   Cluster sizes should balance **batch efficiency** and **grading
        accuracy**.
