   •	Provide real-time fraud and grading insights via an interactive dashboard.

**2. Admin Authentication & Access Control**
   Technologies: Node.js, Firebase Auth, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Purpose:
   •	Authenticate registered users and enforce role-based access (Admin, Reviewer, Auditor).
   •	Restrict access to flagged fraud reports based on RBAC & ABAC policies.
   •	Secure API access with JWT tokens and OAuth authentication.

**3. AI Backend API Service**
   Technologies: Python, FastAPI, Redis Cache, Celery Purpose:
   •	Handle all backend logic, API routing, and fraud/feedback processing.
   •	Use Redis caching for quick access to pre-validated summaries.
   •	Implement asynchronous processing via Celery for large batch fraud detection.

**4. AI Fraud Detection & Short-Answer Grading Models**
   Technologies: Python, FAISS, SBERT, LSTM, Isolation Forest, Scikit-Learn Purpose:
   •	Detect Answer Collusion via FAISS + SBERT vector similarity search.
   •	Identify Time-Based Answer Manipulation using LSTM for sequence tracking.
   •	Flag abnormal candidate behavior with Isolation Forest anomaly detection.
   •	Cache flagged results for efficient processing and expert review.

**5. Large Language Models (LLMs) for Grading & Fraud Analysis**
   Technologies: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Graph Neural Networks Purpose:
   •	Grade short-answer responses using Claude 3.5 Sonnet + XML-structured prompts.
   •	Analyze flagged responses and provide automated feedback to candidates.
   •	Generate human-like explanations for fraud detection alerts.

**6. AI Guardrails for Validation & Compliance**
   Technologies: Guardrails AI, JSON Schema Validation, FastAPI Middleware Purpose:
   •	Apply structured input validation for grading & fraud detection requests.
   •	Validate AI-generated responses (ensure correct format: grade, feedback, confidence).
   •	Filter hallucinations and enforce Responsible AI guidelines.
   •	Prevent prompt injection attacks using middleware security policies.

**7. Secure Fraud Report Storage & Grading Reports Storage & Encryption**
   Technologies: Weaviate, MongoDB, AES-256 Encryption, Splunk Logging Purpose:
   •	Store graded responses and flagged fraud reports securely.
   •	Encrypt sensitive fraud data using AES-256 encryption.
   •	Enable real-time logging and auditing via Splunk for compliance.

**8. DevOps & CI/CD for Deployment**
   Technologies: GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform Purpose:
   •	Automate CI/CD pipelines for fraud detection and grading services.
   •	Use Dockerized environments for consistent deployments.
   •	Scale applications dynamically using Kubernetes orchestration.

**9. Hosting & Cloud Infrastructure**
   Technologies: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Firebase, Cloud Run, Vertex AI Purpose:
   •	Deploy AI services on Vertex AI for high-performance model execution.
   •	Use Firebase for real-time authentication and NoSQL database management.
   •	Host serverless fraud APIs on Cloud Run for scalability.
