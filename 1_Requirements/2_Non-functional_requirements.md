**Non-Functional Requirements**

1.  **Performance**

    -   The system should process and analyze feedback data within a
        reasonable timeframe to provide timely responses.

    -   Fraud detection algorithms must operate efficiently to handle
        large datasets without significant delays.

2.  **Scalability**

    -   The architecture should accommodate increasing numbers of users
        and data volume without degradation in performance.

        
3.  **Usability**

    -   Design intuitive user interfaces for both reviewers and
        administrators.

    -   Provide clear navigation and accessible features to enhance user
        experience.

5.  **Maintainability**

    -   Develop the system with modular components to facilitate easy
        updates and maintenance.

    -   Document all functionalities and workflows comprehensively.

6.  **Security**

    -   Implement robust security protocols to protect sensitive data.

    -   Regularly update and patch the system to address potential
        vulnerabilities.

7.  **Compliance**

    -   Ensure the system adheres to relevant data protection
        regulations and industry standards.

8.  **Cost Effectiveness**

    -   Optimize infrastructure costs by leveraging **cloud-based
        solutions** (e.g., GCP, Firebase).

    -   Use **efficient AI models** that minimize inference costs while
        maintaining accuracy.

    -   Implement **batch processing** and **caching mechanisms** to
        reduce API usage and operational expenses.

    -   Prioritize **open-source and lightweight frameworks** to avoid
        unnecessary licensing costs.
